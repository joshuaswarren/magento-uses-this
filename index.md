## Welcome to Magento 'Uses This'

### Inspiration 

While this site was launched by <a href="http://joshuawarren.com/">Joshua Warren</a>, like many things concerning Magento, it's a community effort.
This site was inspired by the original <a href="http://usesthis.com/">usesthis.com</a>, but instead focuses on Magento developers, users and sites. 
The inspiration for this site came from this tweet by Piotr Kaminski:
